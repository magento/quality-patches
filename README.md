### Applying a patch

Add to .magento.env.yaml environment variable QUALITY_PATCHES with a list of patches to apply:

```
stage:
    build:
        QUALITY_PATCHES:
            - MCTEST-1002
            - MCTEST-1003
```

Commit and push updated .magento.env.yaml file into the remote branch. Patches will be applied during deploy process.

### Apply patches manually in a local environment

You can apply patches manually in a local environment and test them before you deploy.

To apply patches manually:

1. Add to .magento.env.yaml environment variable QUALITY_PATCHES with a list of patches to apply
2. From the project root, apply the patches:
 `$ ./vendor/bin/ece-patches apply`
 Patches will be applied in the following order:
   - Cloud-required patches
   - Quality patches from .magento.env.yaml
   - Custom patches from the /m2-hotfixes directory.
3. Check with `./vendor/bin/ece-patches status` if the patch was applied
4. Clear the Magento cache `./bin/magento cache:clean`

Test the patches, make any necessary changes to custom patches.

### Revert patches in a local environment

You can revert patches in a local environment to clean instance:

```
./vendor/bin/ece-patches revert
```

Patches will be reverted in the following order:

- Custom patches from the /m2-hotfixes directory.
- Magento-quality patches
- Cloud-required patches
